# Structural properties and a simple dynamical evolution of the football players transfer market network

This is the repository containing materials for a report of the "Complex Networks" (574556) course within the Master on

## Abstract

Football player transfers between clubs are analyzed as an economic network using a straightforward approach. The fundamental structural properties reveal the connectivity of this network and its similarity to other international trade ones. Additionally, the SIS model is introduced as a network dynamics tool that can rudimentary illustrate the financial health of clubs in the market.
