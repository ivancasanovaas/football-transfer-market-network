# Network


This folder contains the original dataset:

* :clipboard: [Dataset](dataset/README.md)

And the Jupyter Notebook `network_creation.ipynb` processes the original football transfer market to finally obtain an undirected and unweighted network with the clubs as nodes and the links as the player transfers between clubs. The final network is provided in edge list format `edges.txt`, and another extra file `nodes.txt` is generated to assign a club to each number.
